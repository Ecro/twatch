# Practice and Completion Content - Writing Requirements

This document outlines the requirements and considerations for writing the script content for the Practice Mode and Tutorial Completion screens (Task 2.3), focusing on encouraging practice and providing a clear conclusion.

## Practice Mode Content:

1.  **Prompting:** Write concise text that prompts the user to attempt a specific gesture during practice.
    *   **Consideration:** Should be encouraging and clear, e.g., "Try the 15 Point gesture!"

2.  **Success Feedback:** Write brief messages confirming a successful gesture attempt.
    *   **Consideration:** Positive reinforcement, e.g., "Great!", "Success!", "Well done!"

3.  **Failure Feedback/Hints:** Write concise messages indicating an unsuccessful attempt and potentially offering a hint.
    *   **Consideration:** Should be helpful but not discouraging, e.g., "Try again.", "Make sure your flick is quick."

## Tutorial Completion Content:

1.  **Completion Message:** Write a clear and congratulatory message indicating the user has finished the tutorial.
    *   **Consideration:** Should feel like a positive conclusion, e.g., "Tutorial Complete!", "You did it!"

2.  **Summary/Next Steps:** Briefly summarize what the user has learned and suggest what they can do next (e.g., "You're ready to track scores in a match.").

## General Writing Considerations:

*   **Brevity:** Keep messages very short for quick reading on a watch.
*   **Tone:** Maintain an encouraging and positive tone, especially in the practice and completion sections.
*   **Clarity:** Use simple, direct language.
*   **Consistency:** Ensure the tone and style align with the welcome and instruction content (Tasks 2.1 and 2.2).

## Potential Deliverables for this Subtask:

*   A document listing the final, concise text for practice prompts, feedback messages, and the completion screen.
