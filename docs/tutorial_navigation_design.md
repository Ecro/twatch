# Tutorial Navigation - Design Requirements

This document outlines the requirements and considerations for designing the navigation elements and flow within the Gesture Scoreboard tutorial (Task 1.4).

## Overall Navigation Flow:

*   Define the sequence of screens the user will follow through the tutorial (Welcome -> Purpose -> Gesture Demonstrations -> Practice Mode -> Completion/Exit).
*   Specify entry points (first launch, re-entering tutorial).
*   Specify exit points (tutorial completion, skipping).

## Navigation Controls:

*   Design clear and intuitive controls for moving through the tutorial.
*   Consider different interaction methods suitable for Wear OS:
    *   Buttons (on-screen)
    *   Swipe gestures
    *   Physical button actions (if applicable and feasible)
    *   Rotary input (bezel or crown, if applicable and feasible)

## Specific Navigation Actions:

1.  **Next/Proceed:** How does the user move to the next step or screen?
2.  **Previous/Back:** How can the user go back to review previous information or demonstrations?
3.  **Repeat:** How can the user repeat a gesture demonstration or practice attempt?
4.  **Skip Tutorial:** Design the UI element and behavior for skipping the entire tutorial from relevant screens.
5.  **Exit Tutorial:** How does the user exit the tutorial flow when completed or skipped?

## Design Considerations for Wear OS Navigation:

*   **Consistency:** Navigation controls and patterns should be consistent throughout the tutorial.
*   **Clarity:** Navigation options must be easily visible and understandable on the small circular display.
*   **Touch Targets:** Ensure touch targets for on-screen controls are large enough for easy interaction on a watch.
*   **Efficiency:** Navigation should be quick and not hinder the user's progression.
*   **Visual Alignment:** Consistency with the overall visual design system (Task 1.5).

## Potential Deliverables for this Subtask:

*   User flow diagram illustrating all possible navigation paths.
*   Wireframes or mockups showing navigation controls on different screen types.
*   Specifications for gesture-based navigation (if used).
*   Notes on interaction design for all navigation actions.
