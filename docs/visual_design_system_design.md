# Tutorial Visual Design System - Design Requirements

This document outlines the key elements and considerations for defining the visual design system for the Gesture Scoreboard tutorial UI (Task 1.5).

## Core Visual Elements:

1.  **Color Palette:** Define the primary and secondary colors for the tutorial UI.
    *   **Consideration:** High contrast is essential for readability on a small watch display, especially in varying lighting conditions. Adhere to Wear OS color best practices.

2.  **Typography:** Select the fonts and define text styles (sizes, weights) for different UI elements (headings, body text, labels).
    *   **Consideration:** Readability on a small circular screen. Use scalable fonts.

3.  **Iconography:** Define the style and set of icons to be used throughout the tutorial.
    *   **Consideration:** Icons should be simple, clear, and easily recognizable on a small size. Adhere to Wear OS icon guidelines.

4.  **Component Styles:** Define the appearance of common UI components like buttons, text fields, progress indicators, and backgrounds.
    *   **Consideration:** Ensure components are visually consistent and optimized for the circular display and touch targets.

## Consistency and Application:

*   Ensure the defined visual style is applied consistently across all tutorial screens:
    *   Welcome and Introduction Screens (Task 1.1)
    *   Gesture Demonstration Screens (Task 1.2)
    *   Practice Mode UI (Task 1.3)
    *   Navigation Elements (Task 1.4)
*   Maintain visual harmony with the overall app if applicable.

## Wear OS Specific Considerations:

*   **Circular Display:** Design elements and layouts should work well within the constraints of a circular screen, avoiding critical information being cut off by the bezel.
*   **Performance:** Visual elements (especially animations or high-resolution images if used) should be optimized for performance and battery life.
*   **Accessibility:** Ensure the visual design supports accessibility requirements (e.g., sufficient contrast for users with low vision).
*   **Material Design for Wear OS:** Align the visual design with Material Design principles and components for Wear OS where appropriate.

## Potential Deliverables for this Subtask:

*   Style guide document detailing color palette, typography, and iconography.
*   Examples of styled UI components.
*   Notes on how the visual system applies to specific screen types.
*   Asset specifications (e.g., icon sizes, image formats).
