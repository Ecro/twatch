# Tutorial Introduction User Flow

This document outlines the user flow for the initial welcome and introduction screens of the Gesture Scoreboard tutorial on Wear OS.

## Flow:

1.  **Welcome Screen:** User launches the app for the first time.
    *   Displays a welcome message and the app name.
    *   Action: Tap or swipe to proceed.

2.  **Purpose Explanation Screen:** Explains the core value proposition.
    *   Highlights gesture scoring and solving score-keeping hassle.
    *   Action: Tap or swipe to proceed.

3.  **Tutorial Start/Skip Screen (Optional initial screen):** Prompts the user to start the full gesture tutorial.
    *   Call to action to start the tutorial.
    *   Option to "Skip Tutorial".
    *   Action: Tap "Start Tutorial" to go to Task 1.2, or Tap "Skip Tutorial" to go to the main app.

## Considerations:

*   Designed for quick interaction on a small watch screen.
*   Uses simple vertical scrolling if content requires it.
*   Clear visual indicators for progression.
*   Easy access to the "Skip Tutorial" option.
