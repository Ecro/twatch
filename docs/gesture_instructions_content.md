# Gesture Instruction Content - Writing Requirements

This document outlines the requirements and considerations for writing the script content for the gesture demonstration screens (Task 2.2), focusing on clear and concise instructions for each of the four scoring gestures.

## General Writing Considerations:

*   **Brevity:** Keep instructions extremely short, ideally under 100 characters per gesture's instruction set.
*   **Clarity:** Use simple language and active voice.
*   **Accuracy:** Instructions must precisely match the required physical movement for each gesture as designed for the IMU detection (Task 5).
*   **Consistency:** Use a consistent format for presenting instructions for each gesture.
*   **Action-Oriented:** Focus on the action the user needs to perform.
*   **Wear OS Context:** Remember the user is likely looking at a small screen and may be in motion.

## Content Requirements for Each Gesture:

For each of the four gestures (15, 30, 40, Game), provide:

1.  **Gesture Name/Score:** Clearly state the score associated with the gesture (e.g., "15 Points").

2.  **Instruction Text:** Write the step-by-step or single-phrase instruction for performing the gesture.

### Examples (Drafts to be refined):

*   **15 Points:**
    *   Text: `Flick wrist up once.`
*   **30 Points:**
    *   Text: `Flick wrist up twice.`
*   **40 Points:**
    *   Text: `Flick wrist down once.`
*   **Game Point:**
    *   Text: `Make a clockwise circle.`

## Coordination with Other Tasks:

*   Align instruction text with the visual demonstrations designed in Task 1.2.
*   Ensure terminology matches any audio cues or haptic feedback explained elsewhere.

## Potential Deliverables for this Subtask:

*   A document listing the final, concise instruction text for each of the four gestures.
