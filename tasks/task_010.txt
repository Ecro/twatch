# Task ID: 10
# Title: Create Tutorial Onboarding Animation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop an engaging onboarding animation that introduces the concept of gesture scoring to new users.
# Details:
Create a brief (5-10 second) onboarding animation that:

1. Shows a stylized tennis player making a scoring gesture
2. Demonstrates the watch recognizing the gesture
3. Shows the score changing on the watch face
4. Communicates the core value proposition visually
5. Uses minimal text to support the visual story
6. Optimizes for the circular watch display
7. Sets a friendly, approachable tone for the app
8. Transitions smoothly into the first tutorial screen

Use vector animations to minimize file size and ensure smooth playback. The animation should be skippable with a tap for returning users.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test animation performance on actual Galaxy Watch 5 hardware
2. Measure load time and ensure it doesn't delay app startup significantly
3. Test with users to ensure the concept is clearly communicated
4. Verify animation displays correctly on the circular screen
5. Test skip functionality works properly
6. Measure battery impact of the animation
7. Validate that animation sets appropriate expectations for the app
