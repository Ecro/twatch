# Task ID: 2
# Title: Develop Tutorial Script Content
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Write clear, concise tutorial script content that guides users through learning the four tennis score gestures.
# Details:
Create script content for each tutorial screen:

1. Welcome screen: "Welcome to Gesture Scoreboard! Track your tennis scores with simple wrist gestures."

2. Purpose explanation: "This app lets you record scores without touching your watch. Just use one of four wrist gestures during play."

3. For each gesture (create separate screens):
   - 15 points gesture: "For 15 points, quickly flick your wrist up once."
   - 30 points gesture: "For 30 points, quickly flick your wrist up twice."
   - 40 points gesture: "For 40 points, quickly flick your wrist down once."
   - Game point gesture: "To record a game win, make a clockwise circle motion."

4. Practice instructions: "Let's practice! Try each gesture when prompted and feel the watch vibrate when recognized."

5. Completion message: "Great job! You're ready to start tracking scores. Start a match when you're ready to play."

Keep all text under 100 characters per screen to ensure readability on the watch display. Use active voice and simple language.

# Test Strategy:
1. Review script with tennis players to ensure terminology is correct
2. Test readability on actual Galaxy Watch 5 devices
3. Verify character count stays within limits for each screen
4. Conduct A/B testing with alternative phrasings if possible
5. Ensure instructions match the actual gesture recognition implementation
6. Test with non-tennis players to ensure clarity for beginners
