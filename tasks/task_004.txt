# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop Practice Mode for Tutorial
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create an interactive practice mode that allows users to try each gesture and receive immediate feedback during the tutorial.
# Details:
Implement a practice mode component that:

1. Prompts user to perform each gesture one at a time
2. Listens for gesture input using the IMU pattern recognition system
3. Provides visual feedback when gesture is detected:
   - Green checkmark and text for correct gesture
   - Red X and hint text for incorrect gesture
4. Delivers haptic feedback:
   - Short vibration for correct gesture
   - Long vibration for incorrect gesture
5. Shows a countdown timer (3-5 seconds) for each practice attempt
6. Allows multiple attempts per gesture
7. Includes a 'Skip Practice' option
8. Tracks success rate to determine if additional practice is needed

The practice mode should use the same gesture recognition logic that will be used in the main app to ensure consistency between training and actual use.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test gesture recognition accuracy with various users
2. Verify haptic feedback works correctly for both success and failure cases
3. Test timer functionality and ensure it's visible and understandable
4. Validate that practice mode correctly identifies all four gestures
5. Test edge cases where gestures might be confused with each other
6. Ensure skip functionality works properly
7. Test with users of different physical abilities and wrist sizes

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate Gesture Detection System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement and integrate the gesture detection module using an IMU pattern recognition system or a framework like MediaPipe. Ensure real-time gesture recognition and accurate mapping to tutorial actions.
### Details:
Set up the gesture detection pipeline, preprocess input data, and connect the recognition output to the practice mode logic.

## 2. Develop Visual Feedback System [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create a visual feedback mechanism that responds to detected gestures, providing users with immediate, clear cues about their performance.
### Details:
Design UI elements (e.g., overlays, animations, color changes) that indicate correct or incorrect gestures and guide users through the tutorial steps.

## 3. Implement Haptic Feedback [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Add haptic feedback (e.g., vibration) to reinforce gesture recognition results, enhancing the user's learning experience.
### Details:
Configure device vibration or other haptic responses to trigger on gesture success, failure, or other key tutorial events.

## 4. Build Attempt Tracking and Timing System [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Track each user attempt, including timing and number of tries, to monitor progress and provide performance insights.
### Details:
Log gesture attempts, record timestamps, and store relevant data for later analysis and feedback.

## 5. Add Skip Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Implement a feature allowing users to skip tutorial steps or gestures, ensuring flexibility and user control.
### Details:
Provide a UI control or gesture to skip current practice steps, updating the system state accordingly.

## 6. Develop Success Rate Analytics [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.4
### Description: Create analytics to calculate and display user success rates, error rates, and other relevant metrics for practice mode.
### Details:
Aggregate attempt data, compute success/error rates, and present analytics in a user-friendly format within the tutorial interface.
