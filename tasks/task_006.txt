# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Tutorial Navigation System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a navigation system for the tutorial that allows users to move between steps, skip sections, and track progress.
# Details:
Develop a tutorial navigation system that:

1. Provides clear 'Next' and 'Back' buttons for moving between tutorial screens
2. Shows a progress indicator (e.g., dots or progress bar) showing current position
3. Includes a 'Skip Tutorial' button that takes users directly to the main app
4. Saves tutorial completion status to prevent showing it on subsequent app launches
5. Implements smooth transitions between tutorial screens
6. Provides a way to access the tutorial again from settings
7. Handles interruptions (notifications, calls) gracefully
8. Supports swipe gestures for navigation as an alternative to buttons

Use WearOS navigation patterns and ensure all interactive elements are large enough for comfortable touch interaction on the small watch screen.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test navigation flow with actual users to ensure intuitive progression
2. Verify progress indicator accurately reflects position in tutorial
3. Test skip functionality works correctly and saves state
4. Validate that tutorial state is preserved if app is closed mid-tutorial
5. Test interruption handling (notifications, battery warnings, etc.)
6. Ensure touch targets are appropriately sized for watch interface
7. Test swipe gesture recognition accuracy and sensitivity
