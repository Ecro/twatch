# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement IMU Gesture Recognition Model
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a lightweight neural model for on-device recognition of the four tennis score gestures using the watch's IMU sensors.
# Details:
Create a TensorFlow Lite model for gesture recognition that:

1. Processes data from accelerometer and gyroscope sensors
2. Recognizes four distinct gestures:
   - Single upward wrist flick (15 points)
   - Double upward wrist flick (30 points)
   - Single downward wrist flick (40 points)
   - Clockwise circular wrist motion (Game point)
3. Runs efficiently on Galaxy Watch 5 hardware
4. Processes sensor data at minimum 20Hz sampling rate
5. Returns confidence scores for each gesture type
6. Filters out non-gesture movements during normal play
7. Implements a sliding window approach for continuous monitoring
8. Optimizes for low battery consumption

Use a CNN or LSTM architecture optimized for time-series data. The model size should be under 1MB to ensure fast loading and minimal memory usage. Include preprocessing logic to normalize and filter raw sensor data.

# Test Strategy:
1. Collect training and testing data from at least 20 different users
2. Measure accuracy, precision, and recall for each gesture type
3. Test with users of different physical characteristics (height, wrist size, etc.)
4. Benchmark inference time on Galaxy Watch 5
5. Measure battery impact during continuous monitoring
6. Test in actual tennis playing conditions to measure false positive/negative rates
7. Validate model works with different watch wearing positions
8. Perform cross-validation to ensure model generalizability
