# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Tutorial Accessibility Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure the tutorial is accessible to all users by implementing appropriate accessibility features.
# Details:
Add accessibility features to the tutorial:

1. Implement TalkBack support with descriptive content for all UI elements
2. Ensure all text meets contrast requirements (minimum 4.5:1 ratio)
3. Add alternative text descriptions for all animations and visual demonstrations
4. Support text scaling for users with vision impairments
5. Ensure haptic feedback is strong enough for users with reduced tactile sensitivity
6. Add option to slow down animations for better comprehension
7. Implement keyboard/button navigation for users who can't use touch gestures
8. Test and optimize for WearOS accessibility services

Follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards where applicable to watch interfaces. Use the WearOS accessibility APIs to ensure compatibility with system accessibility services.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test with TalkBack enabled to verify all elements are properly described
2. Measure text contrast ratios to ensure compliance
3. Test with users who have various disabilities if possible
4. Verify text scaling doesn't break layouts
5. Test haptic feedback with users who have reduced sensitivity
6. Validate that slowed animations remain informative
7. Test navigation using hardware buttons only
8. Verify compatibility with all WearOS accessibility services
