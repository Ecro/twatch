# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Tutorial Animation System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create animations that demonstrate the correct execution of each scoring gesture to help users learn the proper movements.
# Details:
Develop a lightweight animation system for the tutorial that:

1. Shows a 3D or 2D representation of a wrist/watch performing each gesture
2. Highlights the motion path with trailing effects
3. Loops animations until user proceeds to next step
4. Includes the following animations:
   - Single upward wrist flick (15 points)
   - Double upward wrist flick (30 points)
   - Single downward wrist flick (40 points)
   - Clockwise circular wrist motion (Game point)
5. Optimizes animations for performance on Galaxy Watch 5
6. Includes subtle highlighting to emphasize key motion aspects
7. Synchronizes animations with tutorial script text

Use vector animations where possible to reduce file size. Ensure animations are accurate representations of the gestures that will be recognized by the IMU pattern recognition system.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test animation performance on Galaxy Watch 5 to ensure no frame drops
2. Verify animations accurately represent the gestures that will be recognized
3. Conduct user testing to ensure animations are clear and instructive
4. Test battery impact of running animations
5. Verify animations display correctly on the circular watch face
6. Ensure animations are visible in various lighting conditions

# Subtasks:
## 1. Animation Framework Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the core animation system architecture for the wearable device tutorial
### Details:
Design and implement the base animation framework that supports vector-based hand animations and full-screen background images. Include support for custom animations like bounce and rotation effects. Consider the resource constraints of wearable devices and implement the framework with minimal battery impact.

## 2. Individual Gesture Animations Development [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create specific animations for each tutorial gesture that accurately represent user actions
### Details:
Develop parameterizable animations for each gesture in the tutorial. Implement motion interpretation to translate user actions into visual feedback. Include direct input mode for mirroring user movements and command input mode for triggering specific animations. Ensure animations clearly demonstrate the expected hand and body movements.

## 3. Animation-Text Synchronization System [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Implement a system to synchronize tutorial text instructions with corresponding animations
### Details:
Create a timing mechanism that coordinates the display of text instructions with their associated animations. Implement event triggers that advance both text and animations at appropriate moments. Include support for user-paced progression through the tutorial with visual cues indicating when to perform each gesture.

## 4. Performance Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Optimize the animation system for smooth performance on wearable devices
### Details:
Conduct performance testing to identify and resolve bottlenecks in the animation system. Implement techniques to reduce CPU/GPU usage such as frame skipping for less critical animations. Optimize vector graphics rendering and implement caching mechanisms where appropriate. Measure and minimize battery consumption impact of the tutorial animation system.
