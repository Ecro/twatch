# Title: Implement Tutorial Completion Celebration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 6
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a brief celebration moment when users successfully complete the tutorial to provide positive reinforcement.
# Details:
Implement a tutorial completion celebration that:

1. Shows a congratulatory message
2. Includes a small animation (confetti, checkmark, or similar)
3. Provides distinct haptic feedback pattern
4. Displays a 'Start Match' button to proceed to the main app
5. Shows a brief preview of the match scoring screen
6. Keeps the celebration brief (2-3 seconds) to maintain app flow
7. Includes encouraging text about being ready to score matches
8. Optionally shows user's practice success rate as positive feedback

The celebration should be lightweight and quick to load, with optimized animations for the watch hardware.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test user reaction to the celebration to ensure it's motivating
2. Verify animation performance on Galaxy Watch 5
3. Test haptic feedback pattern is distinct and noticeable
4. Ensure 'Start Match' button works correctly
5. Validate that the preview accurately represents the match screen
6. Test that celebration doesn't delay transition to main app
7. Verify all elements display correctly on the watch face
