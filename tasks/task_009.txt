# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Tutorial Analytics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Add analytics tracking to measure tutorial effectiveness and identify potential improvements.
# Details:
Implement analytics tracking that:

1. Records tutorial start, completion, and abandonment events
2. Tracks time spent on each tutorial screen
3. Measures success rate for each gesture during practice mode
4. Logs which gestures require multiple practice attempts
5. Tracks use of skip options
6. Measures correlation between tutorial completion and subsequent app usage
7. Implements funnel analysis for tutorial steps
8. Stores analytics data locally and syncs when phone connection is available

Use a lightweight analytics implementation suitable for WearOS. Ensure all tracking complies with privacy regulations and user consent requirements.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify all analytics events are properly triggered and recorded
2. Test data transmission when watch connects to phone
3. Validate that analytics don't impact app performance
4. Check that all required metrics are being captured accurately
5. Test offline functionality to ensure data isn't lost
6. Verify privacy compliance and data anonymization
7. Test with analytics debugging tools to ensure proper implementation
