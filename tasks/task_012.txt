# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Tutorial Localization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: low
# Description: Prepare the tutorial for localization to support multiple languages and regions.
# Details:
Set up localization infrastructure for the tutorial:

1. Extract all text strings to resource files
2. Implement a localization system compatible with WearOS
3. Create placeholder translations for major languages (English, Spanish, French, etc.)
4. Ensure layouts accommodate text expansion/contraction in different languages
5. Use culturally neutral icons and visuals
6. Add region-specific tennis terminology where needed
7. Implement right-to-left (RTL) layout support
8. Create a testing framework for verifying localized content

Use Android's standard localization resources and follow WearOS best practices for internationalization. Ensure all string resources are properly externalized from code.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test layouts with text expanded by 30% to simulate longer translations
2. Verify RTL layouts display correctly
3. Test with pseudo-localization to catch hardcoded strings
4. Validate that all strings are properly externalized
5. Test with actual translations if available
6. Verify cultural appropriateness of visuals across regions
7. Test font rendering for non-Latin character sets
8. Ensure all tutorial functionality works across all supported languages
