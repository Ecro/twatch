# Task ID: 7
# Title: Integrate Tutorial with Main App Flow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Connect the tutorial experience with the main app flow, ensuring it appears for first-time users and can be accessed later if needed.
# Details:
Implement logic to:

1. Show tutorial automatically on first app launch
2. Store completion status in local preferences
3. Add a 'Tutorial' option in the app settings menu
4. Create smooth transition from tutorial completion to main match setup screen
5. Implement a 'quick reminder' option that shows abbreviated gesture guides
6. Add logic to suggest tutorial if multiple gesture misrecognitions occur
7. Create a tutorial completion event that triggers appropriate analytics
8. Handle edge cases like app updates or reinstallation

Use SharedPreferences to store tutorial completion status. Ensure the tutorial can be triggered programmatically from multiple entry points in the app.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test first-launch experience on fresh installation
2. Verify tutorial doesn't appear for returning users
3. Test manual launch from settings menu
4. Validate analytics events are properly triggered
5. Test quick reminder functionality
6. Verify tutorial suggestion logic works when gesture errors occur
7. Test across app updates to ensure preferences are preserved
8. Validate transition animations between tutorial and main app
