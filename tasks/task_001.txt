# Task ID: 1
# Title: Design Initial Gesture Tutorial UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a user-friendly tutorial interface that introduces new users to the four predefined wrist gestures for score tracking.
# Details:
Design a step-by-step tutorial UI that:
1. Welcomes users to Gesture Scoreboard
2. Explains the purpose of the app
3. Shows visual demonstrations of each gesture (15, 30, 40, Game)
4. Includes animated illustrations of proper wrist movements
5. Provides practice mode where users can try each gesture with feedback
6. Uses simple, clear language appropriate for the small watch screen
7. Implements a progress indicator showing tutorial completion
8. Includes a 'Skip Tutorial' option for returning users

The tutorial should be designed for Galaxy Watch 5's circular display, with high contrast and readable text. Use the WearOS design guidelines for button sizes and touch targets.

# Test Strategy:
1. Conduct usability testing with 3-5 tennis players of varying experience levels
2. Verify tutorial completion rate metrics
3. Test readability in outdoor lighting conditions
4. Ensure animations accurately represent the required gestures
5. Validate that users can successfully perform gestures after completing the tutorial
6. Test skip functionality works correctly
7. Verify UI elements display properly on Galaxy Watch 5
